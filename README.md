# 🗒️ Py.Skeletal-Variation

Exploring the bones of certain species using Python

The comparison of skeletons across species lead to historical insights in evolutionary biology. In this project, you will explore the bones of the human body and make comparisons to a wide variety of mammals and birds. 

## ✨ Features
-Import Libraries and Read files 🆕<br/> 
-Data exploration ✅<br/> 
-Visualisation 🔍 <br/> 
-Test Hypothesis ❌<br/> 

## 🧠 Software Used
- Python - Pandas
- Google Colab

## 🧩 Project Hypothesis
-50% of bones are in hands and feet
-Infants have more bones than adults
-All mammals have 7 neck vertebrae

## 🚀 Methods
-Import library: Pandas
-Data Exploration <br/> 
-Data Count/sum <br/> 
-Sort values <br/> 
-Data visualisation <br/> 
-Conditionals <br/> 

## 💡 Project results
- Over 51% of bones are found in the hands and feet.
- Human infants have 305 bones, many of which fuse together, resulting in 206 bones in the adult body.
- Humans have 7 neck vertebrae.
- Certain animals does not have 7 neck vertebrae.
- The most common number of neck vertebrae is 13, but it looks like 23 is the maximum.
- The bird with the maximum number of neck bones is the "Mute swan" with 23.
